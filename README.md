# Simpidemic

## Simulator for Epidemics

This is an experimental simulator written in JavaScript.

Note that this is a very simple model that is only intended for experimenting
with the mathematics of epidemics. Real public health models, such as those used by the
CDC are much more complicated.

 The simulator is online [here](https://philburk.github.io/simpidemic/simpidemic.html).
